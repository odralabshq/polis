Break implementation/architectureinto features/stages. First version should be the foundations and once this is implemented we will keep adding features to it. Please create linear issues as markdown file according to instructions found in ways-of-working.md

I need issues created as golden input for each feature/stage. Put them in a new folder under linear-issues/ as markdown files.

Use sequential thinking, internat and other MCP tools you have available.
