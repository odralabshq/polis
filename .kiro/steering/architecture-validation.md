# Context

I'm building Polis, a secure multi-agent workspace system for AI coding agents. I have a document (attached) that outlines proposed architectural and/or solution that need validation through deep research.

## Your Task

Conduct deep research on the document below. For each section:

1. **Validate Proposed Solutions**: Research whether the proposed implementations are sound. Look for:

   - Industry best practices

   - Similar implementations in production systems

   - Potential pitfalls or edge cases not covered

2. **Identify Gaps**: Find anything the RDC missed:

   - Security considerations

   - Performance implications

   - Edge cases

   - Integration challenges with dependent RDCs

   - Create a list of open questions.

3. **Answer Open Questions**: For each open question:

   - Research existing solutions and patterns

   - Provide a concrete recommendation with justification

   - Include code examples or references where helpful

4. **Provide References**: For each finding, cite:

   - Documentation links

   - GitHub repos with similar implementations

   - Blog posts or papers that informed your recommendation

## Output Format

Structure your response as:

### Research Findings

#### [Topic 1]

- **Current Proposal**: [What the RDC says]

- **Research Finding**: [What you found]

- **Recommendation**: [Keep/Modify/Replace]

- **References**: [Links]

#### [Topic 2]

...

### Open Questions Resolved

#### Q1: [Question]

- **Answer**: [Your recommendation]

- **Rationale**: [Why]

- **Implementation Notes**: [How]

### Identified Gaps

1. [Gap description and recommended solution]

2. ...

Use sequential thinking, internet and other tool you have available to do a deep research.
