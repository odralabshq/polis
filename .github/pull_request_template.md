<!--
  ⚠️  BASE BRANCH: Make sure the base branch is set to `develop`, not `main`.
  PRs targeting `main` directly will be rejected unless they are release merges from `develop`.

  MERGE STRATEGY:
  - feature/* → develop : merge commit (preserves agent commit history)
  - develop  → main     : squash merge (one clean commit per release)
-->
